# Kali-Dark

Kali linux dark Theme 

Sometime after updating kali the dark theme which we love is not available in preferences.

Steps to use Simple Dowload this add-kali-dark.sh file and give executable permission (sudo chmod +x add-kali-dark.sh).

After this ./add-kali-dark.sh.

And Here we go again go to preferences and change it to kali-dark and enjoy dark theme ...........
